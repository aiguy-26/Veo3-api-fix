# VEO 3 Python API: A Corrected and Working Example

**Last Updated: August 2025**

If you've tried to use Google's official Python code snippets for the new VEO 3 video generation API and have been met with a frustrating series of errors, you are in the right place. This repository provides a single, functional Python script that works.

The official documentation, as of this date, is misleading and appears to use a version of the SDK that is not publicly available or has a different API structure, leading to a cascade of problems. This guide and script are the solution.

## The Problems This Script Solves

You have likely encountered one or more of the following issues, which this script has been specifically engineered to fix:

1.  **The `ImportError` Trap:** The official examples use `from google import genai`, which fails with an `ImportError: cannot import name 'genai' from 'google'`. This is often due to namespace conflicts with other installed `google-*` libraries. This script uses the correct library and import structure that is proven to work.

2.  **The `pip` Cache and `--pre` Issue:** Simply running `pip install --upgrade --pre google-generativeai` often doesn't work. `pip`'s cache can prevent it from installing the correct preview version, or the required library isn't available on PyPI via this flag at all. This solution uses the correct, stable `google-cloud-aiplatform` dependencies under the hood.

3.  **The `Client()` Initialization Failure:** The documented `genai.Client()` call will throw an `AttributeError` or a `ValueError: Missing key inputs argument!`. Our script uses the correct `genai.Client(vertexai=True, ...)` initialization, which properly authenticates with your Google Cloud project.

4.  **The `operations.get()` `TypeError`:** The method for polling a completed operation is also documented incorrectly. Simply passing a name string fails. This script correctly wraps the operation name in a `types.GenerateVideosOperation` object before polling.

5.  **The File Downloading `AttributeError` Maze:** This was the most frustrating discovery. The API response object for the generated video does **not** have a `.name` or `.file.name` attribute for downloading. The video data is embedded directly in the response. This script correctly accesses the video data from the **`.video.video_bytes`** attribute and writes it to a file.

6.  **The Overwriting Output File Issue:** Running the script multiple times would overwrite the previous video. This script automatically generates a **unique, timestamped filename** for every video, so you never lose your work.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you absolutely must have the following:

1.  **Python 3.9+** with `pip`.
2.  **A Google Cloud Project** that has been approved and "allowlisted" for the VEO 3 preview.
3.  **The Google Cloud CLI installed** on your machine.
4.  **Authenticated Your Environment:** You must run this command in your terminal and log in. This is not optional; the script relies on it.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

## How to Use This Solution

**1. Set up your project folder:**

Create a folder for your project. It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts.

```bash
# Create and navigate to your project folder
mkdir my-veo-project
cd my-veo-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
2. Install the Correct Dependencies:
The key is to install the google-generativeai library with the --pre flag to get the necessary preview features.
code
Bash
pip install --upgrade --pre google-generativeai
3. Download the Script:
Save the provided Python script in this repository as generate_veo_video.py in your project folder.
4. Configure the Script:
Open generate_veo_video.py and edit the configuration section at the top. You must replace the placeholder values.
code
Python
# --- 1. CONFIGURATION: EDIT THESE VALUES ---
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
PROMPT = "A cinematic, wide shot of a futuristic city at sunset, with flying vehicles."
5. Run the Script:
Execute the script from your terminal.
code
Bash
python generate_veo_video.py
The script will initialize the client, submit the request, and poll every 10 seconds until the video is complete. Your final video will be saved in the same directory with a name like veo_video_2025-08-14_11-30-55.mp4.
This solution is the product of significant trial-and-error. Hopefully, it saves you the frustration and allows you to get straight to creating with this incredible new model.
