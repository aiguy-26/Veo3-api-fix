VEO 3 Python API: A Corrected and Working Example
Last Updated: August 14, 2025
If you've tried to use Google's official Python code for the new VEO 3 video API via a Google Cloud project and have been met with a frustrating series of TypeError and AttributeError messages, you are in the right place. This repository provides a single, functional Python script that correctly handles the Vertex AI backend for VEO 3.
The official documentation is not wrong, but it is deeply misleading for Vertex AI users. It describes the workflow for the standard Gemini API, but the Vertex AI client (genai.Client(vertexai=True, ...)) behaves differently in critical, undocumented ways. This guide and script are the solution.
The Core Problem: Vertex AI vs. The Standard Gemini API
The root of all the confusion is that the google-genai library has two modes:
Standard Gemini API: Uses an API key for authentication. The code snippets in the official documentation work perfectly for this mode.
Vertex AI Backend: Uses your Google Cloud project credentials (gcloud auth). This is the mode you use for enterprise projects. This client has a different, non-obvious way of handling long-running operations.
This script is specifically for Vertex AI users.
The Problems This Script Solves
You have likely encountered one or more of the following issues, which this script has been engineered to fix:
1. The Polling Loop Trap (AttributeError: 'NoneType' object...)
This was the most painful issue. In the Vertex AI client, the standard polling loop shown in the docs (operation = client.operations.get(operation)) does not work correctly. While it updates the .done status, it fails to populate the final .response attribute, leaving it as None.
Solution: This script uses an unusual but necessary method of "re-hydrating" the operation object on each loop (types.GenerateVideosOperation(name=...)) which correctly fetches the final result.
2. The Silent Prompt Safety Filter Failure
If your prompt is flagged by Google's safety filters (e.g., for referencing drug-related topics, even indirectly), the API will not give you an immediate error. Instead, the operation will run, complete with .done = True, but the .response will be None and an error message will be hidden inside the .error attribute. This looks exactly like a code bug.
Solution: Our script correctly checks for a None response after the loop and prints the content of .error, immediately telling you if the problem was your prompt, not your code.
3. Incorrect client.operations.get() Usage (TypeError)
The Vertex AI client is extremely particular about the get() method. Passing a string or the wrong object type will result in a TypeError.
Solution: The script uses the correct types.GenerateVideosOperation object wrapper, which is the only method that works.
4. The Overwriting Output File Issue
Running the script multiple times would overwrite the previous video.
Solution: This script automatically generates a unique, timestamped filename for every video, so you never lose your work.
Prerequisites
Before running the script, you absolutely must have the following:
Python 3.9+ with pip.
A Google Cloud Project that has been approved and "allowlisted" for the VEO 3 preview.
The Google Cloud CLI installed on your machine.
Authenticated Your Environment: You must run this command in your terminal and log in. This is not optional; the script relies on it.
code
Bash
gcloud auth application-default login
How to Use This Solution
1. Set up your project folder
It is highly recommended to use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts.
code
Bash
# Create and navigate to your project folder
mkdir my-veo-project
cd my-veo-project

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
2. Install the Correct Dependencies
This command installs the necessary generative AI library and the underlying cloud libraries it needs to function with the Vertex AI backend.
code
Bash
pip install --upgrade google-generativeai google-cloud-aiplatform```

#### 3. Configure the Script

Download the `generate_veo_video.py` script from this repository. Open the file and edit the configuration section at the top. You **must** replace the placeholder values.

```python
# --- 1. CONFIGURATION: EDIT THESE VALUES ---
PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1" # Or your supported VEO region
PROMPT = "A cinematic, panning shot of a majestic snow-capped mountain at sunrise."
4. Run the Script
Execute the script from your terminal.
code
Bash
python generate_veo_video.py
The script will initialize the client, submit the request, and poll every 10 seconds until the video is complete. If it succeeds, your final video will be saved in the same directory with a name like veo_video_2025-08-14_14-30-00.mp4. If it fails, it will print the exact error message from the API.
This solution is the product of a painful, multi-hour debugging session. Hopefully, it saves you the same headache.
